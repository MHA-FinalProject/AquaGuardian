## Project Overview

Aqua Guardian is a rehabilitative game designed to assist stroke patients in improving hand and finger mobility. The game is integrated with the Amadeo device, which tracks finger movements, allowing patients to control a diver navigating through underwater caves. The primary objective is to reach a treasure chest while maintaining oxygen levels and avoiding obstacles.

### Key Features:
- **Patient-Centric Gameplay**: Customizable difficulty levels to match individual patient needs.
- **Real-Time Feedback**: Both audio and visual feedback mechanisms to guide and motivate patients.
- **Engaging Visuals**: Realistic ocean environments and dynamic animations to enhance patient immersion.

## Problem Statement

Patients recovering from a stroke often struggle with hand movement, making rehabilitation exercises challenging and demotivating. Traditional rehabilitative games lack engagement, which can lead to poor adherence to therapy. Aqua Guardian aims to address this by providing a more enjoyable and motivating experience.

## Project Objectives and Methodology

### Objectives:
1. **Enhanced Engagement**: Develop a game that is more engaging and motivating than existing solutions.
2. **Tailored Difficulty**: Adjust game parameters to suit each patient's capabilities and needs.
3. **Focused Rehabilitation**: Target individual finger movements to improve hand functionality.

### Methodology:
- **Game Design**: The patient controls a diver navigating through underwater caves. The game adapts to the patient’s abilities, ensuring that it remains challenging yet manageable.
- **Data Integration**: Real-time force data from the Amadeo device is used to control the diver’s movements, ensuring accurate reflection of the patient’s input.
- **Customization**: Game parameters such as cave size, diver speed, and oxygen levels can be customized to match the patient’s rehabilitation needs.

## Gameplay Mechanics

The game begins with setting parameters to adjust difficulty. The diver must navigate through caves, follow directional arrows, and collect oxygen balloons. Collisions with caves result in oxygen loss, and the objective is to reach the treasure chest before oxygen runs out.

### Critical Components:
1. **Cave Navigation**: Patients must apply the correct amount of force to avoid collisions and maintain oxygen levels.
2. **Feedback Systems**: Both audio and visual cues provide immediate feedback, helping patients understand their performance.
3. **Progress Tracking**: A progress bar shows the patient’s current position in the game and the remaining distance to the treasure chest.

## Evaluation and Results

### Experimentation:
The game was tested with patients at the Beit Loewenstein Rehabilitation Center. The tests involved adjusting the game’s difficulty based on the patient's current functional level. Feedback from patients and observations by Dr. Shay indicated that Aqua Guardian provided a more engaging and motivating experience compared to existing games.

### Patient Feedback:
- **Increased Engagement**: Patients reported higher motivation and willingness to continue playing.
- **Positive Emotional Response**: Patients expressed enjoyment and satisfaction with the game, which contributed to longer play sessions and better rehabilitation outcomes.

## Conclusion and Future Improvements

Aqua Guardian has shown promise as a valuable tool in stroke rehabilitation. Future enhancements could include adding a pause button for breaks and a scoring system to track patient progress and motivate continued improvement.
